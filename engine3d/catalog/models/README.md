# Theme model files

Each JSON file here adds critters and/or props to the catalog, in the same format as `../models.json`
(`{ "description", "critters": {}, "props": {} }`). `catalog/index.mjs` merges `models.json` and every file in
this folder (sorted by name); a model name may be defined only once across all files.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `animals.json` | More toy animals for habitats, stories and phonics |
| `home_school.json` | Home, health, food, school and maths props |
| `outdoor_science.json` | Science kit, vehicles, town, playground, weather and plant props |
