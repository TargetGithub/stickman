# Stickman Action Engine

A deterministic 2D stickman animation engine. An LLM writes short JSON scripts; the engine simulates them, renders every frame, and produces a YouTube-ready MP4.

**Status:** planning complete, scaffold in place, implementation starting at milestone M0.

## Layout

```
engine/    runtime logic, zero dependencies (runs in Node and the browser)
data/      poses, moves, props, FX presets, themes, SFX keys
tools/     Node CLIs: validate, record, mix, sfxgen, catalog, generate, serve
web/       browser pages: player, pose/move editor, move catalog
assets/    fonts, sfx, music (with license records)
scripts/   sample scripts
tests/     unit, integration, golden frames, fixtures
docs/      design documents
out/       render output (ignored)
```

## Commands

```bash
npm test
```

```bash
npm run serve

Then open http://localhost:5173/web/index.html. Recording (`npm run record -- scripts/samples/showdown.json`) arrives in milestone M6 and needs ffmpeg.
